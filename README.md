## What I build

- **GoHighLevel setup + migrations** (pipelines, calendars, forms, automations)
- **AI-assisted workflows** (Zapier/Make/n8n, webhooks, routing, lead enrichment)
- **Landing pages + funnels + tracking** (conversion-first, not “pretty only”)
- **Reporting dashboards** (what’s working, what’s leaking, what to fix next)
