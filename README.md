# Ecker Labs

I build ROI-first AI automation, lead-gen systems, and lightweight apps for local businesses (GoHighLevel, integrations, and custom workflows).

**What you get:** more booked calls, faster follow-up, cleaner pipelines, and measurable ROI.

---

## What I build
- **GoHighLevel setup + migrations** (pipelines, calendars, forms, automations)
- **AI-assisted workflows** (Zapier/Make/n8n, webhooks, routing, lead enrichment)
- **Landing pages + funnels + tracking** (conversion-first, not “pretty only”)
- **Reporting dashboards** (what’s working, what’s leaking, what to fix next)

---
